# graphing UI

I would like to use a graph of terraform resources to show me what is planned and particularly what failures exist in the plan, so that I can diagnose and fix the errors faster.

I would like the graph to be interactive: I want to expand and collapse modules, for instance.
I would like to be able to move nodes around to better suit my visual needs.
