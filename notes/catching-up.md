# catching up

thoughts on trying to catch up with this project:

1. `terrascope module` is noted as "EXPERIMENTAL". Can I do something to get it stable?
2. `terrascope provider` seems solid
3. I came back to this project because I have a renewed interest, especially as it concerns an interactive UI
4. `feature/scopes` branch sounds like it is VERY CLOSE to stable. I'd like to wrap up that if it's quick...
